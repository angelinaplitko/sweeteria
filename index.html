          <h3>Our Story</h3>
          <p>
            Sweeteria was born from a simple idea: to create a place where
            sweetness and joy come together. Our journey began in a small
            kitchen, where our founder, inspired by a love for baking and a
            desire to spread happiness, started crafting delightful treats.
            Today, Sweeteria has grown into a beloved bakery known for its
            exquisite desserts and warm atmosphere. Every cake and pastry we
            create is a testament to our commitment to quality, creativity, and
            customer satisfaction. Join us in celebrating life's sweetest
            moments at Sweeteria!
